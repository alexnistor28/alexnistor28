### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Alex, a very excited and passionated person, who's at the begging of his proffesional path. Programming has been a very important part of my life since I first started coding in highschool. From that moment on, I realised that I wanted to transform it from just a hobby into a successful carrer. I'm looking forward to learning, growing, accomplishing my goals and becoming the best version of myself, both proffesionally and personally. 

Moreover, I'm an open person, I enjoy listening to others and, also, being listened to.
